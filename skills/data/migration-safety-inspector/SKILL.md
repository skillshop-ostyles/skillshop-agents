Read-only. Trigger: /migration-safety"

## What this is for

Database migrations are the leading cause of production incidents. Missing
CONCURRENTLY, ALTER COLUMN TYPE causing full-table rewrites, destructive DROP
without rollback, unsafe constraint additions with no lock-timeout - every SQL
migration file carries risks that schema review often misses.

This skill automates the safety review: a deterministic collector finds all SQL
migration files, parses every DDL statement, and checks 20+ safety rules. The
LLM then assesses the blast radius of each finding against the actual schema
and usage patterns, and recommends safer alternatives.

## What You Must Do When Invoked

### Step 1 - `-help`/`-h` check
If `-help` or `-h` is passed, print the `## Usage` block below and stop.

### Step 2 - Confirm project directory
Confirm `-ProjectDir` is provided and the path exists.

### Step 3 - Run collector
```powershell
& "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/migration-scan.ps1" -ProjectDir "<path>"
```

### Step 4 - LLM reads findings
Read the JSON output. For each finding, note the severity, line, description,
and DDL statement. The collector categorizes findings by safety rule:
- **table-rewrite**: ALTER COLUMN TYPE, ADD COLUMN NOT NULL without DEFAULT
- **missing-concurrently**: CREATE INDEX, REINDEX, VACUUM without CONCURRENTLY
- **destructive**: DROP TABLE, DROP COLUMN, TRUNCATE
- **unsafe-constraint**: ADD FOREIGN KEY without NOT VALID
- **missing-if-exists**: DDL referencing objects without IF EXISTS / IF NOT EXISTS
- **dml-on-migration**: INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on existing tables in migration
- **missing-transaction**: DDL statements not wrapped in a transaction

### Step 5 - Assess blast radius per finding
For each finding, the LLM should:
- Search the project for the affected table/column/index usage patterns
- Estimate: is this acceptable in a maintenance window?
- Consider: rows affected, locks held, replication lag, rollback cost
- Recommend a safer alternative (e.g. NOT VALID, CONCURRENTLY, multi-step)

### Step 6 - Write report
Write `migration-safety-report.md` to the working directory with:
- Executive summary (files scanned, total findings, by severity)
- Critical findings (destructive, table rewrites on large tables)
- Medium findings (missing CONCURRENTLY, unsafe constraints)
- Low findings (missing IF EXISTS, missing transaction wrappers)
- Safer alternatives per finding
- Open questions (cannot determine table size or usage)

## Usage

```
/migration-safety                           # interactive, prompts for directory
/migration-safety <dir>                     # scan SQL migration files in directory
/migration-safety -help                     # show usage
```

## Report Format

`migration-safety-report.md` with:
- Executive summary (files scanned, statements, total findings by severity)
- Critical findings (destructive operations, table rewrites on referenced columns)
- Medium findings (missing CONCURRENTLY, unsafe constraints, DML on existing tables)
- Low findings (missing IF EXISTS, missing transaction wrappers)
- Per finding: file, line, DDL, blast radius estimate, safer alternative
- Open questions
