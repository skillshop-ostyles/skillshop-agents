# /data-trail-tracker

## What this is for

"Where is all the personal data?" - the GDPR question no team can fully answer.
This skill scans code for PII field patterns (email, iban, phone, address,
etc.) in model definitions and traces where those fields flow to logs,
external APIs, exports, storage, and deletion sites.

Scans codebase for PII field candidates (email, iban, phone, address, etc.) in
TS/JS, SQL, and Prisma model definitions, then traces where those fields flow:
log statements, external API calls, file exports, storage writes, and
deletion/anonymization signals.

## What You Must Do When Invoked

1. If `-help` or `-h` is passed, print the `## Usage` block below and stop.
2. Confirm `-ProjectDir` is provided and the path exists.
3. Run: `scripts/pii-scan.ps1 -ProjectDir "<path>"`
4. LLM reads the JSON output and maps each PII candidate to its sinks,
   identifies gaps (PII defined but unsinked), and assesses deletion
   readiness.
5. Write `data-trail-report.md` to the working directory.

## Usage

```
/data-trail-tracker                    # interactive, prompts for directory
/data-trail-tracker <dir>              # scan project directory
/data-trail-tracker -help              # show usage
```

Returns JSON with `piiCandidates` (structure, field, file, source) and `sinks`
(log, external, export, storage, deletion).
