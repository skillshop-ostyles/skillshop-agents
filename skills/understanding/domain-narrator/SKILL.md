Collector extracts public symbols and call graphs; LLM per cluster produces domain name, business responsibility (1-2 sentences), and business rules extracted from code. Read-only. Audience: Both.

## What this is for

Everyone can say what a module technically does — but what is its *business* responsibility? This skill extracts every public symbol, builds a call graph, clusters modules by dependency density into business domains, and produces a plain-English domain narrative describing each cluster's purpose, responsibilities, and extracted business rules.


## PROTECTION RULE - never ~/.claude/

Read-only skill. Guard required if write mode added later.

## ## What You Must Do When Invoked
During analysis, assign a confidence level to each finding: proven (confirmed by evidence), likely (strong signal, needs review), or suspected (weak signal).

### Step 1

1. If `-help` is passed, print the `## Usage` block below and stop.

### Step 2

2. Confirm `-ProjectDir` is provided and the path exists.

### Step 3

3. Run: `scripts/domain-map.ps1 -ProjectDir "<path>"`

### Step 4

4. Read the JSON output. For each cluster in `result.clusters[]`:

### Step 5

- **Domain name:** What business concept does this cluster represent?

### Step 6

- **Business responsibility:** 1-2 sentences explaining what this domain does in business terms.

### Step 7

- **Business rules:** Extract business rules from the code (e.g., "orders cannot be cancelled after payment", "auth tokens expire in 1h").

### Step 8

- **Module dependency graph:** For each module in the cluster, note which other clusters it depends on (interClusterCalls > 0).

### Step 9

5. Write `domain-narrative.md` to the working directory with one section per cluster.

## Usage

```
/explain                           # interactive
/explain <dir>                     # scan project
/explain -help                     # show usage
```

Returns JSON with `modules[]`, `clusters[]`, `callGraph{edges[], density}` plus summary counts.
