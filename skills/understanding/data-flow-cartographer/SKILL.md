Generates Mermaid flow diagrams per data flow with origin, schema changes, validation gaps, and security relevance. Read-only. Audience: Senior. Trigger: /dataflow"

## What this is for

Every data flow is a trust boundary. Input reaches a handler, is transformed, and ends up in a DB, an API call, a log, or a file. This skill traces each flow from source to sink — capturing intermediate assignments, validation gaps, and PII/payment exposure — then generates Mermaid diagrams for visualization.

**Audience:** Senior
- Security engineers use it to find unvalidated data paths.
- Architects use it to understand coupling between input and storage.
- Anyone debugging "where does this data actually go?"


## PROTECTION RULE - never ~/.claude/

Read-only skill. Guard required if write mode added later.

## ## What You Must Do When Invoked
During analysis, assign a confidence level to each finding: proven (confirmed by evidence), likely (strong signal, needs review), or suspected (weak signal).

### Step 1

1. If `-help` / `-h` is passed, print the `## Usage` block below and stop.

### Step 2

2. Confirm `-ProjectDir` is provided and the path exists.

### Step 3

3. Run: `scripts/flow-scan.ps1 -ProjectDir "<path>"`

### Step 4

4. LLM reads the JSON output. For each data flow:

### Step 5

- **Data origin:** Identify the input source type and the field names extracted.

### Step 6

- **Schema changes:** What transformations occur between source and sink? (parsing, validation, renaming, aggregation, encryption)

### Step 7

- **Validation gaps:** Does the path contain `if`/`typeof`/`validate`/`zod`/`joi` checks? If not, flag as unvalidated.

### Step 8

- **Security relevance:** Does any field match PII patterns (email, iban, phone, address) or payment (card, cvc, amount, currency)? Mark as sensitive.

### Step 9

- **Mermaid diagram:** For each flow, generate a `flowchart LR` diagram: `Source -->|field names| Transformer -->|field names| Sink`. Include validation checkpoints as diamond nodes.

### Step 10

5. Write `dataflow-report.md` to the working directory with all Mermaid diagrams.

## Usage

```
/dataflow                          # interactive
/dataflow <dir>                    # scan project
/dataflow -help                    # show usage
```

Returns JSON with `flows[]`:
`{inputFile, inputLine, sinkFile, sinkLine, sourceType, sinkType, hops[], hasValidation}` plus summary counts.
