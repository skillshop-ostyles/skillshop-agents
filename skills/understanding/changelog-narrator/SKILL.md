description: "Changelog narrator: reads the diff between two tags/commits, clusters changes into logical groups (features, bugfixes, refactoring, dependencies), and writes a semantic changelog with breaking changes, migration notes, and deployment risk. Collector extracts git diff and clusters by module; LLM classifies each change as feature/bugfix/chore/refactor/breaking, writes migration notes, and assesses deployment risk. Read-only. Audience: Both. Trigger: /changelog"

## What this is for

`git log` tells you what changed. It does not tell you what *kind* of change it is, whether it breaks callers, or what the deployment risk is. This skill reads a git diff, clusters changes by module, classifies each cluster by semantic type, writes migration notes for breaking changes, and produces a deployment risk assessment.

## What You Must Do When Invoked

1. If `-help` is passed, print the `## Usage` block below and stop.
2. Confirm `-ProjectDir` is provided and the path exists.
3. Run: `scripts/diff-trace.ps1 -ProjectDir "<path>"` (optional: `-FromRef`, `-ToRef`).
4. LLM reads the JSON output. For each module in `modules[]`:
   - **Feature**: new capability. Describe what it does and who benefits.
   - **Bugfix**: defect corrected. Reference the symptom and impact.
   - **Refactoring**: structural change with no external behaviour change. Why was it done?
   - **Chore**: dependency update, tooling, CI. Note any breaking version bumps.
   - **Breaking change**: API renaming, removed exports, changed signatures. Write migration note.
5. Per breaking change, write a **migration note**: old call site, new call site, automated migration if possible.
6. Assess **deployment risk** per change group: None / Low / Medium / High.
7. Write `CHANGELOG.md` to the working directory.

## Usage

```
/changelog                            # interactive (default HEAD~10..HEAD)
/changelog <dir>                      # scan project
/changelog <dir> -FromRef v1.0 -ToRef v1.1
/changelog -help                      # show usage
```

Returns JSON with `commits[]`, `files[]`, `modules[]`, `stats{}`, `changeSummary{}`.
