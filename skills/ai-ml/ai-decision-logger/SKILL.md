# /ai-log

AI decisions must be auditable. This skill finds every model-based decision point and checks logging coverage.

## What this is for

- Model output used in conditionals without audit logging
- Classification results used for actions without context
- Approval/recommendation decisions missing human review path
- **Read-only skill.** No code changes.

## What You Must Do When Invoked

If `/ai-log -help` or `/ai-log -h` (without further arguments)
is invoked: output the `## Usage` section unchanged and stop.

Otherwise follow these steps in order, skipping none.

### Step 1 - Clarify target

Clarify `-ProjectDir`. Get confirmation.

### Step 2 - Scan

```powershell
& "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/ai-decision-scan.ps1" -ProjectDir "<path>"
```

### Step 3 - Classification

For each decision point:

- **Auditable**: full context logged + human review option
- **Partially-logged**: some context captured
- **Black-box**: no log, no audit trail

### Step 4 - Write report

File `ai-decision-report.md` in current working directory:

1. **Summary** - decisions by classification.
2. **Decision table** - black-box first. Per decision: file, line, decision type, has audit log, includes context, has human review, risk.
3. **Open questions**.

### Step 5 - Summarize

State report path, highlight black-box decisions.

## Usage

```
/ai-log                     # interactive
/ai-log <dir>               # scan project
/ai-log -help
```
